# geoCon
Takes an output file from GeoClaw and creates a tiff file using QGIS libraries.

The extension, when prompted, must be an integer, e.g. 9 or 15.

The resulting files will be in a folder named the current date and time.

The finalized, colored image will be named after the extension that was input.
